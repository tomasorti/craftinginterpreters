As much as it has a feared reputation, I actually really like the dragon book.
If I could only take one, it would be that.

Programming Language Pragmatics, 
Engineering a Compiler, 
Types and Programming Languages, and 
The Garbage Collection Handbook 
are all really solid and well-written. ...

Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs,]
The Art of the  Metaobject Protocol, and 
Lisp in Small Pieces are all mind-expanding.

Build Your Own Lisp,
The C Programming Language (K&R),
Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs, and 
Writing an Interpreter in Go are super fun concise reads.
